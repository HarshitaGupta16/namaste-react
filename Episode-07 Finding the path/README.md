# 2 types of Routing in web apps

- Client Side Routing:
  - We don't make any server calls while we are moving to any page because all the components are already loaded into our app.
  - This is what Single page application is. This is the explaination for Single Page Application also.
  - As it is just one page, just the components getting interchanged cia client side routing.
- Server Side Routing:
  - All routes are connected with anchor tag so if we click on /about, it reloads/refreshes the whole page
  - It sends the network call to about.html, fetches that html and renders it onto the webpage.
  - That's how our websites used to work.
